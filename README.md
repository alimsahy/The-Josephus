# The-Josephus

This math problem based on something from history. There was group of Jewish soldiers who were surrounded by the Roman army and they didn't want to get captured, so they decided to come up with a system to avoid getting captured or suicide. So they'd sit in a circle, and the first man would kill the guy to the left of him.
